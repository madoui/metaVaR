Description: metaVaR provides various functions to build metavariant species (MVS) and to analyse their populationgenomics. metaVaR uses metavariants computed by DiscoSnp++ (Peterlongo et al., 2017) from metagenomic reads. The metavariants can be clustered by species using density-based clustering (dbscan) applied on their loci depth of coverage. Once clustered, the allele frequencies of MVS populations are used to infer genomic differentiation and to identify loci under selection.
